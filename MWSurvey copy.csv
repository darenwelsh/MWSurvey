7/15/2015 12:39:24,Just Me,5+ years,1,Public,Just me,1.25,Every minor point release,"A custom, non-public spam blocking extension that hooks into my internal spam blocking system","I use MediaWiki in a similar fashion as Wikipedia, but as an ""encyclopedia"" exclusively for my comic strip and the rest of my site built around it. As of this writing, this wiki is publicly readable, but I am the only sysop and the sole contributor. MediaWiki makes this relatively easy, and having an interface familiar to my users (who are likely to already be familiar with Wikipedia) makes my wiki easier to use. (I once considered building my entire site around Wikipedia, but for reasons outlined in the following question, I'm glad I didn't go that route.)","MediaWiki does pretty much everything I expect and want from it. If I have any complaints, they are chiefly around much things change between releases. As an example, I had a significant problem upgrading from version 1.23 because of the complete restructuring of how skins were handled. I was using a custom skin which I had to abandon because I did not have time to completely rewrite it to fit with 1.24+. Fortunately, I was able to work around this by using MediaWiki's built-in custom CSS and JavaScript functionality, but I wasted a full day trying to figure out how this worked. Such a major restructuring in a ""minor point release"" is an annoyance, and I don't think it was communicated well to downstream, non-WikiMedia users of MediaWiki. MediaWiki development seems to be very fast and volatile, making building a third-party site based upon it a risky and difficult process. Non-WikiMedia users are left to fend for themselves as the software seems to change at the slightest whim of Wikipedians.","This has been brought up on the mailing lists before, but it would be nice if the development around MediaWiki were less Wikipedia-centric and took more into consideration the needs of MW users outside WikiMedia. While we all understand that Wikipedia is the chief user and poster child for the software, by releasing it for others to use WikiMedia now has an obligation to listen to its outside users. Bug reporting and handling isn't the issue there, but adding or changing features requires better coordination and communication.",,"Unfortunately, the main barriers that prevent my personal participation are my own constraints on time and other obligations. While I try to contribute to answering questions on the mailing lists from time to time, they usually get answered by someone more knowledgeable than me by the time I finally get around to them. I'm afraid there's not much I could offer in ways to improve participation at this time."

","We use MediaWiki primarily for company process, policy, and technical documentation. We use it (instead of other options) primarily because of the stability and flexibility it provides. Additionally Semantic MediaWiki and its related extensions provide a lot of power that we haven't seen in other platforms. ","For the most part the core MediaWiki code is pretty solid; however, the addition of composer, specifically extension installation via composer, has been a bit of a bear. Using composer for standard libraries that MediaWiki makes sense, and allows easier standardization for any extensions that want to use the same libraries. However, when it comes to extensions it has become a bit of a mess, especially with trying to efficiently control how they are managed. Especially if I need to quickly disable one on the fly for some quick testing (extension conflicts), or just troubleshoot a particular extension with a debugger. ","Support for private wikis, or maybe better communication around private wikis. The impression that I get is that private wikis are a little bit of an afterthought. It's still good that we're addressed and not ignored, but I suspect there may be more out there in corporate environments than people are aware of. 

Also, there's very much a wikipedia centric focus. That's not unsurprising or necessarily always bad, but there are cases where it's detrimental to the improvement of the community. For instance, from what I've seen the development of an Upload UI for VisualEditor has been stalled out due to copyright concerns. While this is a very valid concern for the open internet at large, but for internal wikis we'd at at least like something bare-bones we can use. In a corporate environment, lacking an editor that is ""easy to use"" is a big detractor. ",I contribute feedback and bug reports,I can't think of any major barriers to participation.

Old bugs = long-term bugs, and those are bad.",I'm not sure what I have to fill in here :),"I contribute feedback and bug reports, I help with documentation, I contribute patches and bug fixes, I contribute code to MediaWiki core, I contribute to extensions","There must be a friendly environment, better documentation (imo especially old docs from 8 years ago are a mess) and no one should be afraid of contributing :)"
